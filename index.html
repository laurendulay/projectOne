      <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
        Hi! I'm Lauren. My career path has been as smooth as walking on cobblestone in stilletos.
            <br>
            <br>
        I started off my post-grad career as a paid editorial intern for a women's lifestyle website and loved it! Unfortunately, they weren't hiring. After months of doing temp work, I took a job in advertising for financial reasons, where I enjoyed talking to my coworkers more than the job itself.
            <br>
            <br>
        After two years, I quit my job and decided to listen to my family's advice of doing something more practical like working in healthcare. At first going back to school for a makeshift post-bacc was fine. However, I soon realized it wasn't for me, but now I was stuck in another career path that left me unfulfilled.
            <br>
            <br>
        Months of thinking made me realized I want to do something that's practical, yet creative. I remember being fascinated by the developers I befriended by during my paid internship many years ago and their encouragement to start learning how to code. Now here I am currently enrolled in a Fullstack Development course at New York City College of Technology while working a survival job and taking acting classes in my spare time. 
            <br>
            <br>
        After this Fullstack course, I'm hoping to continuing my coding journey and possibly gain an entry-level developer position or even an entry-level editorial position that utilizes HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
